Demo code of "EMS-GCN: An End-to-End Mixhop Superpixel-Based Graph Convolutional Network for Hyperspectral Image Classification"

## Step 1: compiling cuda files
```
cd lib
. install.sh ## please wait for about 5 minutes
```
you can also refer to [ESCNet](https://github.com/Bobholamovic/ESCNet) for the compiling process.

## Step2: train and test
```
cd ..
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES='7' python main.py
```

## Step3: record classification result
